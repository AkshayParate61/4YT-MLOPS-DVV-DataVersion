1. Create git repo and clone it in local.
2. Create mycode.py and add code to it. (it wiil save a csv file to a new "data" folder)
3. Do a git add-commit-push before iniatializing DVC.
# pip install dvc
4. Now we do "dvc init" (create .dvcignore, .dvc)
5. Now do "mkdir S3" (creates a new S3 directory)
6. Now we do "dvc remote add -d myremote S3" [Note: If we have AWS S3 bucket then instead of "S3 Folder name which we created here" just put path of S3 in AWS]
7. Next "dvc add data/" 
   Now it will ask to do: ("git rm -r --cached 'data'" and "git commit -m "stop tracking data"")
   Because initially we were tracking data/ folder from git so now we remove it for DVC to handle.
   [Note: Its like 'git add .' command and after running this command we expected error like 'git' 
   already tracking and we you want to track 'dvc' the must run these two command 1.'git rm -r --cached 'data'', 2.'git commit -m "stop tracking data"']
8. Again we do "dvc add data/" (creates data.dvc) then "git add .gitignore data.dvc"
9. Now - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
10. Do a git add-commit-push to mark this stage as first version of data.
11. Now make changes to mycode.py to append a new row in data, check changes via "dvc status"
12. Again - - "dvc commit" and then "dvc push"
13. Then git add-commit-push (we're saving V2 of our data at this point)
14. Check dvc/git status, everything should be upto date.
15. Now repeat step 11-13 for v3 of data.

git log --oneline
git checkout <hash> - git checkout main
dvc pull
